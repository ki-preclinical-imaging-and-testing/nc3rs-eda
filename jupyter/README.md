# Jupyter Notebooks

These are artifacts from the development process. Once everything is finalized,
I would like to go through them and set them up as tutorials.

Additionally, the original notebook should be converted into a living document
so that if any updates are made on the NC3Rs EDA side, then I can walk through
it to more readily identify updates.
